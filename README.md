# Step 1 - Sit back and enjoy

Thanks to the COVID-19 virus, we are limited in making you suffer :( Because of this, please sit back and relax in the comfort of your home. You will use [Thola](https://meet.thola.events/e/cronos/hack-the-future/r/lobby) to work and communicate.

You should attend the **Challenge Briefing** at **09:30**. For this, visit the Main Hall and enter the .NET Challenge room. Inside the .NET Challenge room, click the large TV in the center above the main door to join the Teams meeting.

During the day, you will work together with your partner. In the .NET Challenge room, you should find a desk that has your team name written on it, and click the PC on that desk to join a specific Teams call for your team. The dark agents will be able to join your team to help or ask difficult questions.
