# Hack The Future 2020 - The Fellowship of Code

Welcome to the Hack The Future 2020 .NET Challenge! We hope you are ready and exited for a day of coding, hacking, frustration and lots of fun.

As the challenge above describes, you are to build a computer program, using C# and .NET, that navigates and hopefully solves a dungeon. You are the Fellowship Of Code, we are the dark agents that will challenge you with random dungeons. Please read this documentation carefully, so we can fully enjoy your suffering and agony!

## Step 1 - Sit back and enjoy

Thanks to the COVID-19 virus, we are limited in making you suffer :( Because of this, please sit back and relax in the comfort of your home. You will use [Thola](https://meet.thola.events/e/cronos/hack-the-future/r/lobby) to work and communicate today.
